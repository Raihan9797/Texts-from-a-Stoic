# My first pet project: Texts from a Stoic
Search "@senecaLettersBot" on Telegram to try it out!

## Things to Note
As this bot is being hosted for free on Heroku, apologies for the slow startup times! Also, if enough people use it, it might cause the Bot to shut down (because i only have a limited amount that the bot can run). I might pay for hosting if enough people find it useful!

## What is this?
This is a Telegram Bot that allows you to read the Letters of Seneca, a Stoic philosopher. You can also read the book for free on [Wikisource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius).


## Why did i do this?
I personally wanted to read the letters. But I thought I could add value to it by reshaping it in a modern context. And learn things relevant things in my field of study (computing) along the way!

Seneca wrote the letters to his friend discussing a wide range of topics from our fear of death (imagine texting your friends about this haha), to what a philosopher should strive to do.

Though letters are not as mainstream, some of the ideas still hold some weight. Many well known people like Tim Ferriss (best selling writer and angel investor), Admiral James Stockdale (POW survivor in Vietname) used Stoic principles to get through their day and even survive the harshest of conditions.

To make it more accessible to people, i thought it would be more relevant if they got the letters in text form instead. Which is why the bot was created on Telegram!


## What did i learn from this?
The technical aspects would be:
1. [Basic Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup4](https://github.com/Raihan9797/Web-Scraping-Practice)

2. [How to create a Telegram Bot using python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/Raihan9797/intro-to-telegram-bots)

3. Hosting a bot on Heroku

More interestingly however, I learned:
1. The value of doing things out of interest and how you get to learn practically. It's difficult to self motivate, but when you complete a task, you know it has been done out of passion and not the fear of a bad grade

2. Failing is not a bad thing! Throughout the project, I faced many problems that I could not solve on my own. Obviously, StackOverflow is a godsend. But to get the right answers, you have to ask the right questions. Even then, some of the answers given did not work for me. It might be easy to see that all that work as wasted time, but you would not have learnt that it didn't work for you if you didn't try!

3. Finding out answers on your own. As much as StackOverflow is a great base of knowledge, your problem might be hard to answer. For instance, the Python Telegram Bot API though very popular is still a very niche group. Actually making an effort looking through the docs and even other people's code allows you to understand the inner workings better than just finding a band-aid to your issues.

## Closing thoughts
If you've read this far, thanks for taking the time! Though learning in university is very streamlined with a clear syllabus, creating a usable product with that knowledge is a gap we have to fill for ourselves. 
> Learning is not enough; we must apply.

I hope this serves as an inspiration for you to apply what you know in whatever field you are in!
