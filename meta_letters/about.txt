This bot was created as a pet project not only for me to learn about the Python Telegram Bot API, but also to read the letters of Seneca. It's my first project, so I apologize for any errors and bad formatting. Also, because this bot is hosted for free on Heroku, startup might be slow and it might not work if too many people use it (if there's even that many). The book is free for all to read from Wikisource (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius). If you would like to know more about the code, here is my github link: https://github.com/Raihan9797
